            Sanskrit is an ancient and classical language of India belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the
            Indo-European languages.
            It is considered to be the mother of most Indian languages except Dravidian Family
            Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism, the language of classical Hindu philosophy, and of historical
            texts of Buddhism and Jainism.
            It is an inflected language, and its nominal system, including nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, has three
            genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), and seven syntactic
            cases (nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, etc.)

        <h4 style="padding-left:50px;">Some key facts about Sanskrit include:</h4>
        <p>
            Origins: Sanskrit arose in South Asia after its predecessor languages had diffused there from the northwest
            in the late Bronze Age. The Vedas, the most ancient documents in Sanskrit, were composed in what is called
            Vedic Sanskrit.
            Grammar: In its grammatical structure, Sanskrit is similar to other early Indo-European languages such as
            Greek and Latin. It is an inflected language.
            Resemblances: Sanskrit has many resemblances with other classical languages of the Indo-European group like
            Greek, Latin, and other alike languages.
            Importance: Sanskrit is recognized in the constitution of India as both a classical language and an official
            language and continues to be used in scholarly, literary, and technical media, as well as in periodicals,
            radio, television, and film.
            Revival: There have been recent attempts to revive Sanskrit as a spoken language so that the rich Sanskrit
            literature could become accessible to everyone. India’s Central Board of Secondary Education has made
            Sanskrit a third language in the schools under its jurisdiction. In such schools, the study of Sanskrit is
            compulsory for grades 5 to 8. An option between Sanskrit and Hindi exists for grades 9 and 10. Many
            organizations are conducting ‘Speak Sanskrit’ workshops to popularize the language.
            The study of Sanskrit provides a foundation in the rich cultural and literary history of South Asia, both
            pre-modern and modern. It opens the door to advanced studies for students of ancient India, Indian
            religions, and comparative linguistics. It also builds analytical, linguistic, and communication skills that
            are transferrable to many other areas like law, government, and tech.
